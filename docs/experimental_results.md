# Experiments

The goal of the experiments is to measure state coverage between different algorithms
- Penalty flavoured algorithms
- Pure random
- Bonus based algorithms

The coverage is measured for different notions of state and different abstractions. 
- State = internal state + bag of messages
- While we run RL with "State", we measure coverage over "internal state"
- We try different abstractions for "internal state"

In additional to different notions of state, we also vary the different actions the algorithms can perform at each step.
